# 2020 Live Election Forecast

### Background
* This shiny dashboard allows you to update states as they are called in the 2020 election and see how the probability of victory for each candidate changes.
* Link to Shiny dashboard: [https://guydotan.shinyapps.io/2020LiveElectionForecast/](https://guydotan.shinyapps.io/2020LiveElectionForecast/)
* Note: picking a winner in a state this is very unlikely to go one way (e.g. CA for Trump or AL for Biden) might cause the dashboard to error out


### Notes
* All credit for the model goes to G. Elliot Morris from the Economist and his election forecast: [Github](https://gist.github.com/elliottmorris/c70fd4d32049c9986a45e2dfc07fb4f0)
